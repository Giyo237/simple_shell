## Simple Shell

The Simple Shell is a basic command-line interpreter program developed in C. It provides a simplified interface for users to interact with their operating system by executing commands.

### Features

- Command Execution: The Simple Shell allows users to execute various commands available in their operating system, such as running programs, managing files, and performing system operations.

- Command Line Parsing: It parses the user input and breaks it down into individual command arguments, allowing for flexibility in command execution.

- Basic Built-in Commands: The Simple Shell includes a few built-in commands that provide functionality like changing directories (`cd`) and exiting the shell (`exit`).

### Usage

1. Compilation: Compile the Simple Shell program using a C compiler.

2. Running the Shell: Execute the compiled binary to start the Simple Shell program.

3. Shell Prompt: Once launched, the Simple Shell displays a prompt where users can enter commands.

4. Command Execution: Enter commands at the prompt to execute them. The shell will parse the input and execute the appropriate commands.

5. Built-in Commands: Utilize the built-in commands like `cd` to change directories or `exit` to exit the shell.
